## Time Spend

This time I tried to add a little time estimation. I estimated 3 hours to develop the entire project, and spend 3.7 hours because a I didn't include any deploy and documentation time.

### What I learned

In this project I tried CSS animations for the fade and slide in effect on the Card. This was my first time doing some css animation.

```css
.card {
  animation: fadeIn 1.2s;
}
@keyframes fadeIn {
  0% {
    top: 100px;
    opacity: 0%;
  }
  100% {
    top: 0px;
    opacity: 1;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

I will try to add more eye-catching elements on future projects, like CSS3 animations. Also I will continue to practice time estimation.

### Useful resources

- [CSS3 Animations](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp) - This helped me to understand how the animation works on CSS3 with examples.
